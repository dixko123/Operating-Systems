# Operating-Systems
Code Challenge

for this challenge we create three different codes for the operating systems class. In this case I used java language, but the logic can be aplied for any programming language:

first problem:
  for this problem we need to find the fisrt letter that doesnt repeat in a String, to verify that this problem works we can edit the String varriable at the beginning of the code at the variable "palabra", this program throws the fisrt letter that doesnt repeat and the ejecution time at the console.
  
second problem:
  for this problem we need to report the media of one Integers chain. In this case the User can add all the numbers as long as he wants, but the media reports is throws at the end, it means if the user doesnt want to add more numbers the media will be reported at that moment.
  
third problem:
  in the case you need to edit two values "N" which is the range and "K" which is the number of items inside the prohibited list, these numbers are random, so you will see in the console two diferent list, one is the prohibited list and the other one are the numbers that doenst exist in the prohibited list.
